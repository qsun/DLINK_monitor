# Why?

I got some issues with Telstra & TPG - their line quality is pretty
bad for me in these days. The noise level on my landline is way too
high. To check if there is a pattern, I need to scrape the stats from
my modem. 

I guess I can surely retrieve this information using SNMP, but that's
too hard-core sysadmin work for me.
